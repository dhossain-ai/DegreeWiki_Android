# DegreeWiki Database Plan

## Purpose

This file summarizes the planned database areas. Detailed SQL will be created in schema phases.

## Database Principles

- PostgreSQL is the source of truth.
- Use Supabase Auth for identity.
- Use Supabase RLS for row-level security.
- Use UUID primary keys.
- Use clear plural table names.
- Store structured data for filtering and AI matching.
- Store markdown/text for rich explanations.
- Track source, verification, and review status for important public data.
- Do not insert AI-extracted data directly into live public tables.

## Core Public Content Tables

Planned core tables:

- countries
- cities
- universities
- campuses
- degree_levels
- subjects
- programs
- program_subjects
- program_intakes
- scholarships
- scholarship_countries
- scholarship_universities
- scholarship_programs
- scholarship_subjects
- scholarship_degree_levels
- articles
- article_categories
- article_countries
- article_subjects
- article_degree_levels
- seo_landing_pages
- seo_page_types

## Program Data

Programs are the core searchable entity.

Important program data:

- title
- slug
- university
- country
- city
- campus
- degree level
- degree award
- subjects
- duration
- study mode
- delivery mode
- language
- tuition
- application fee
- intakes
- deadlines
- admission requirements
- English requirements
- GPA/background requirements
- documents
- curriculum/modules
- career outcomes
- scholarships
- official URLs
- verification status

## Country Profile Enrichment

Phases 73B, 73C, and 73D add and wire enrichment fields on `countries` for richer destination profiles.

Implemented field groups:

- destination facts
- tuition and living-cost overviews plus structured ranges
- admissions, visa, documents, intakes, scholarship, and university-system summaries
- student work and post-study work facts
- official education and visa source URLs
- FAQ JSON content

Still deferred:

- import/staging support for country enrichment

## University Profile Enrichment

Phase 74 adds additive enrichment columns on `universities` and wires them into the admin create/edit
flow plus the public university profile pages.

Implemented university enrichment groups:

- profile identity and classification
- campus summary
- admissions and application summaries
- application and international-admissions URLs
- admissions contact email
- language, scholarship, housing, student-life, international-student, and career-support summaries
- ranking source URL
- existing university SEO fields in admin/public wiring
- edit-only verification/review timestamps in admin

Still deferred for universities:

- QS, THE, or national ranking-specific structured fields
- university-wide tuition or application-fee fields
- `indexing_status` admin/page behavior

## Auth/Admin Tables

Planned tables:

- user_profiles
- roles
- user_roles
- permissions
- role_permissions
- admin_activity_logs

MVP roles:

- student
- contributor
- content_admin
- reviewer
- data_import_manager
- super_admin

## Contributor Foundation

Phase 82B adds the contributor DB/RLS foundation without building the public or admin contributor UI yet.

Implemented contributor tables:

- contributor_applications
- contributor_profiles
- contributor_scopes
- contributor_profile_subjects
- contributor_submissions
- contributor_submission_sources

Implemented contributor rules:

- contributors use the same shared auth system as students
- new users remain non-admin by default
- contributor remains a separate non-admin role with no seeded admin permissions
- contributors never write directly to live public content tables
- contributor submissions stay separate from production content until reviewer/admin action
- private proof metadata stays in contributor applications only and is never publicly readable

Contributor foundation notes:

- `contributor_profiles` supports reviewed public-profile state, public avatar controls, and future attribution
- `contributor_scopes` supports approved country, university, and subject scope rows
- `contributor_submissions` stores future correction/confirmation proposals against live entities without changing those entities directly
- direct public reads from `contributor_profiles` stay blocked; Phase 82D uses a narrow public RPC instead of restoring raw public table access
- Phase 82D adds public-profile request/consent fields on `contributor_profiles`, a safe public contributor RPC, contributor-owned profile-settings RPCs, contributor avatar asset persistence, and admin moderation RPCs for public profile/avatar controls
- contributor avatar uploads remain separate from reusable admin media assets and stay non-public until the contributor consents, the profile is public, and any uploaded avatar is explicitly approved
- actual contributor content-submission UI and proof upload remain deferred to later phases

## Student/AI Tables

Planned tables:

- student_profiles
- student_profile_subjects
- student_profile_countries
- ai_finder_results
- ai_finder_program_matches
- ai_finder_scholarship_matches
- ai_conversations
- ai_messages
- ai_usage_logs
- ai_usage_limit_policies
- ai_static_answers

Usage limit notes:

- `ai_usage_logs` is the append-only quota ledger for successful provider-backed AI calls
- `ai_usage_limit_policies` stores admin-managed per-use-case, per-audience, per-period call caps
- legacy env-based quota fallback still applies when no matching policy row exists
- old usage rows are not backfilled retroactively by use case

## Data Source / Verification Tables

Planned tables:

- data_sources
- source_snapshots
- verification_events
- data_quality_checks

Later:

- entity_field_sources
- broken_link_checks
- source_change_detections

## Static AI Knowledge Base

Reviewed preset Q&A for site chat lives in:

- ai_static_answers

Purpose:

- answer common study-planning questions without calling AI
- keep common site-chat guidance deterministic
- store reviewed plain-text answers only

Rules:

- published rows may be used in site chat
- draft and archived rows remain admin-only
- no HTML rendering
- no Markdown rendering
- no embeddings, RAG, or live internet lookup

## Import / Staging Tables

Planned tables:

- import_batches
- import_files
- staging_universities
- staging_programs
- staging_scholarships
- staging_articles
- staging_errors
- staging_review_actions

Import flow:

1. raw CSV/JSON/source
2. import batch
3. staging rows
4. validation
5. duplicate detection
6. admin review
7. approve/reject/merge
8. publish to live tables

## Staged-to-Production Merge Rules (Phase 44 MVP — Implemented)

Phase 43 + Phase 44 implement one-by-one staged-to-production merge.
Implementation: `src/lib/admin/importMerge.ts`.
UI: `src/pages/admin/imports/[id].astro`.

### Implemented: Phase 44 MVP

Create-new supported entity types:
- universities
- scholarships
- articles
- programs (FK chain–gated: staging_university_id must link to a merged staged university)

Update-existing supported entity types:
- universities (patches official_url if null in production)
- scholarships (patches amount_min and/or deadline_text if null in production)
- articles (patches content if null in production)

Deferred entity types (update-existing):
- programs update-existing — deferred to Phase 45+

Deferred modes:
- bulk merge — deferred indefinitely
- auto-merge — never

### Program Merge — FK Resolution Chain

Requirement: staged program must have staging_university_id set.
Resolution:
  staging_programs.staging_university_id
    → staging_universities.match_university_id (must be non-null; university must be merged first)
    → universities.id (university_id), universities.country_id (country_id)
  staging_programs.extracted_degree_level_code
    → degree_levels.code WHERE is_active = true → degree_levels.id (degree_level_id)

Blocked if: staging_university_id null, university not yet merged,
  degree_level_code not found/inactive, production university missing country_id,
  all slug candidates conflict.

Slug sequence: slugify(title) → title+code → title+code+uniSlug → title+code+shortUniId.

### Update-Existing Rules

- import_status must be 'approved'.
- Relevant match_*_id must be set and must resolve to an existing production row.
- Patch only allowlisted fields.
- Patch only if production field is currently null/empty.
- Never update: slug, content_status, verification_status, indexing_status.
- If nothing safe to patch → return safe error; do not mark merged.
- After successful patch → staging import_status = 'merged'; match_*_id unchanged.

### Merge eligibility (enforced server-side in importMerge.ts)

- `import_status` must be `approved` (re-read from DB at merge time).
- Entity type must be in allowlist: universities, scholarships, articles.
- Row id and batch id must be valid UUIDs.
- Staged row must belong to the current batch (`import_batch_id` match).
- Batch type must match entity type or be `mixed`.
- Confirmation checkbox must be present in POST (`confirm=yes`).
- Required fields must be non-null (entity-specific).
- Production slug must not already exist (uniqueness checked before insert).

### Field mapping (create-new)

**Universities:**
- `name` ← `extracted_name` (required)
- `slug` ← slugified from `extracted_name` (server-generated)
- `country_id` ← looked up from `countries.iso2` using `extracted_country_code` (required; blocks if unresolved)
- `official_url` ← `extracted_official_url` (optional, included if non-empty)
- Defaults: `content_status='draft'`, `verification_status='unverified'`, `indexing_status='draft'`

**Scholarships:**
- `name` ← `extracted_name` (required)
- `slug` ← slugified from `extracted_name` (server-generated)
- `amount_min` ← `extracted_amount` (optional; currency not mapped — no currency in staging)
- `deadline_text` ← `extracted_deadline` (optional; stored as text, no date parsing)
- Defaults: `content_status='draft'`, `verification_status='unverified'`, `indexing_status='draft'`

**Articles:**
- `title` ← `extracted_title` (required)
- `slug` ← `extracted_slug` re-read from DB and validated against strict regex (required)
- `content` ← `extracted_content` (optional, included if non-empty)
- `article_category_id` — deferred; category FK lookup ambiguous (text name vs slug)
- Defaults: `content_status='draft'`, `verification_status='unverified'`, `indexing_status='draft'`

### Post-merge behavior

After successful insert:
- Staging row `import_status` set to `'merged'` (terminal, non-reversible).
- Relevant match column set to the new production id:
  - universities → `match_university_id`
  - scholarships → `match_scholarship_id`
  - articles → `match_article_id`
- `review_notes` left unchanged.
- `verification_events` not written (deferred).
- `data_sources` not linked (deferred).
- `import_batch` counts not updated (deferred).

### Deferred to Phase 44+

- update-existing mode (match columns already exist in staging schema)
- programs merge (needs university_id + degree_level_id + country_id FK resolution)
- duplicate resolution workflow
- verification_events write on merge
- data_sources linkage on merge
- article category FK mapping
- scholarship currency mapping
- field-level source tracking
- bulk merge

### Why bulk merge remains deferred

Bulk merge removes per-record confirmation, preventing destructive overwrite detection.
Risk too high until duplicate resolution is deterministic and field-level source tracking exists.

### verification_events

Not written automatically on merge.
Super admin should create a verification_event manually after confirming data accuracy.
Automated verification_events deferred to a future verification pipeline phase.
