# DegreeWiki Current Status

> AI agent reading rule:
> Read this active status file first for current context. Open archive files only when older phase detail is specifically needed, and pick the smallest matching archive range.

## Current Project Status

Phase 82D is complete. DegreeWiki now includes the contributor public profiles, profile controls,
and avatar bundle: public `/contributors` and `/contributors/[slug]` pages backed by a narrow
public contributor RPC, approved contributor profile controls at `/account/contributor/profile`,
contributor-specific Cloudinary avatar upload endpoints with pending-review persistence, and
expanded admin contributor moderation for safe public fields, visibility enable/disable, and
uploaded avatar approval without restoring direct public reads on raw `contributor_profiles`.

Current branch: `main`

Very short import pipeline summary:
- Program Import Staging is the primary path.
- General Batch Creation stays Advanced / Legacy.
- Review rows first, then choose the production action, then publish only if needed.
- Cleanup is super-admin only and limited to import/staging records.

## Current Import Workflows

- First import: approve -> merge new programs -> publish as unverified.
- Enrichment: approve -> update existing matched programs.
- Approved rows remain the only rows eligible for production actions.
- Batch actions stay scoped to visible or explicitly matched rows unless a deliberate all-matching confirmation is used.

## Critical Rules

- Contributor Phase 82D keeps public contributor exposure narrow:
  no public SELECT on raw `contributor_profiles`, no contributor admin access, no live-content
  publishing or verification actions by contributors, no reuse of the broad admin media endpoints
  for contributor avatars, and no automatic public exposure of Google or uploaded avatars without
  contributor consent plus the required review gates.
- Contributors must not directly publish or verify live public data.
- Keep AI usage-limit rollout incremental: no seeded active policy rows in the migration.
- Preserve legacy env fallback when no matching DB policy exists.
- No new dependencies.
- No service role, `createServiceClient`, or RLS bypass in app pages.
- No production deletion from import cleanup: programs, universities, scholarships, articles, media, and production `data_sources` stay untouched.
- No auto-overwrite of non-empty production fields.
- No subject auto-creation and no intake/deadline import.
- No unsafe HTML APIs such as `set:html` or `innerHTML`.
- Phase 82D checks run:
  `npm run build`,
  `npx tsc --noEmit`,
  `rg -n "innerHTML|set:html|service_role|SERVICE_ROLE|createServiceClient" src`,
  and
  `rg -n "AI_GATEWAY_MASTER_KEY|GEMINI_API_KEY|OPENROUTER_API_KEY|SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" src`.
- Phase 82D keeps scope tight:
  no contributor content-submission UI yet, no proof upload flow, no contributor live publishing,
  no direct public raw table exposure for contributor profiles, no public contributor detail sitemap
  entries yet, and no new dependencies.

## Known Open Notes

- Phase 80B production-hardening target is Cloudflare-first launch on `https://degreewiki.com`.
- `www.degreewiki.com` should redirect to the apex domain and should not be treated as a first-launch auth hostname.
- Astro's Cloudflare adapter expects a production KV binding named `SESSION`; the real namespace must be created and bound in Cloudflare before deploy.
- Google OAuth remains configured in Supabase Auth, not in app runtime env vars.
- Google-created users remain non-admin by default for launch.
- The new `contributor` role is seeded with no admin permissions.
- Public contributor directory/detail pages, contributor profile controls, and contributor avatar
  upload/review now exist, but contributor content-submission UI and proof upload remain deferred.
- `031_contributor_public_profiles.sql` must be applied after the contributor foundation/review
  migrations before live public contributor pages, profile controls, or avatar moderation are used.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` still reports pre-existing repo-wide type errors in older AI/import modules
  outside the Phase 82D contributor files.
- A later follow-up may add explicit `student` role assignment on signup if future features require role membership beyond the current non-admin default.
- Phase 70B kept the article workflow small and safe:
  no migration, no dependency changes, no schema changes, and no create/edit/save/publish contract
  changes.
- Phase 70C keeps AI article assistance equally narrow:
  no migration, no dependency changes, no suggestion persistence, no auto-save, no auto-publish,
  and no automatic body replacement.
- Public guide rendering contracts stayed the same in Phase 70B aside from tiny fallback bug fixes
  for trimmed SEO/meta values and safer OG image URL generation.
- Article verification remains status-only in Phase 70A.
  The admin article editor does not stamp or update `last_verified_at`.
- The admin article assistant uses `use_case = 'admin_article_draft'`, resolves to the `admin`
  audience tier, and requires active AI Gateway routing before it can return suggestions.
- AI usage quotas can now be controlled through `ai_usage_limit_policies` and the
  `/admin/ai-gateway?tab=limits` tab.
- The new quota system checks DB policy first, then falls back to the legacy env-based combined
  daily counting, then fails closed if authoritative counting is unavailable.
- Static site-chat answers and reviewed preset `ai_static_answers` answers remain uncounted because
  they bypass provider-backed AI calls entirely.
- AI Gateway admin tests remain uncounted because they do not use the normal runtime quota/logging
  path.
- Old `ai_usage_logs` rows cannot be perfectly split retroactively by use case because earlier
  successful chat-like calls were logged only by `session_type`.
- DB-backed provider routing is ready, but it still depends on provider/account/model/policy rows
  before it replaces env fallback in practice.
- DB-managed provider accounts currently support `openai_compatible` only.
- Gemini and OpenRouter remain env-fallback only for now, outside the DB-managed provider list.
- The AI Gateway admin page is now a tabbed control center with Overview, Providers, Models,
  Routing, Limits, Testing, and Health tabs.
- The public chatbot shell is limited to `/`, `/programs*`, `/universities*`, `/scholarships*`,
  and `/guides*`. Anonymous visitors get static guidance only; logged-in site chat stays separate
  from saved-result chat and does not attach Finder-result or student-profile context.
- Published `ai_static_answers` rows can now answer common site-chat questions without calling AI.
  Answers are plain text only and are managed at `/admin/ai-knowledge` under `manage_ai_settings`.
- Cloudinary still needs the SHA-256 signature setup, or `CLOUDINARY_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM=sha1` as a fallback.
- Default site OG image is still not configured.
- CSV import and persistent uploaded-file import storage remain deferred.
- Destination country profiles now exist at `/destinations/[slug]`, but guide/article previews for
  countries remain deferred because articles still do not carry a proper country relation.
- Country profile enrichment columns now exist in the schema, the admin country form wires those
  fields for create/edit, and the public destination page now renders the enriched country content.
- Destination sitemap/indexing enforcement remains intentionally deferred until country admin
  exposes `indexing_status`, so published destination pages are still included in the sitemap
  without additional indexing filtering.
- University profile enrichment columns now exist in the schema, the admin university create/edit
  forms wire both the previously hidden existing fields and the new enrichment fields, and the
  public university pages now render the richer profile sections.
- `indexing_status` still exists on universities but remains intentionally deferred for admin/public
  behavior in this phase.
- University-wide tuition/application-fee content and provider-specific ranking fields remain
  intentionally deferred to keep university profiles plain-text, low-risk, and additive.
- After creating the university enrichment migration, it must be applied to Supabase before live
  testing or deployment of admin/public code that queries the new university columns.
- `program_intakes` import remains intentionally deferred.

## Reading Guidance

- Future agents should read archive files only when older context is specifically needed.
- Use the narrowest matching phase range first.
- Prefer the recent task log for current work, and the split archives for older phase details.
